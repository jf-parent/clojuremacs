This is the first emacs config that I use to write code on a regular basis!
Before I was using vim or Spacemacs only. Now I also use Clojuremacs on top of that! 

* Philosophy
** Only do one thing (/editing Clojure code)/ and do it fast and well (/keybinding optimized for lisp editing/). Also be Evil!
** Use literate emacs config (org-mode)

* Keybindings
** [SPACE] => keybinding for lisp editing
** [,] => keybinding for Clojure (currently only cider-jack-in
** [TAB] => other keybinding (windows, projectile, magit, etc)
** M-x => [SPACE][SPACE]
** [s] & [S] => slurp
** [B] & [C] => barf
